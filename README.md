## Deploying the project

First, ensure you have node, npm, and firebase-tools installed.

Next, follow these steps from the "Hosting your React app with Firebase hosting" article.

~~~~

Step 1: Select the Firebase features you want to use. Database and Hosting are selected by default — all you need to do is press enter to go to the next step.
 
Step 2: Firebase command-line interface will pull up your list of Firebase projects, where you can then choose the corresponding project using the up and down keys.
 
Step 3: Keep the default for the Database Rules file name and just press enter.
 
Step 4: Pay attention to the question about public directory, which is the directory that will be deployed and served by Firebase. In our case it is “build”, which is the folder where our production build is located. Type “build” and proceed.
 
Step 5: Firebase will ask you if you want the app to be configured as a single-page app. By default it is “no” — in our case, we could really benefit from the configuration, so we’ll type “y” and press enter. Later on you’ll be able to use react-router and the URLs will just work.
 
Step 6: Firebase will warn us that we already have “build/index.html,” which we don’t want to be overwritten. Type “n” and press enter to keep our own “index.html,” generated by our build process earlier.
 
We are now ready to deploy the app! We’ll do that by running firebase deploy. After a few seconds you'll see the URL — where your app is hosted — of your app. It should look something like https://hosting-react-with-firebase.firebaseapp.com/. woo hoo we did it !.

Now, when you want to build and upload a new version...

From the scribble directory, build the app.

```console
$ npm run build
```

Now the app is ready to deploy.

```console
$ firebase deploy
```
